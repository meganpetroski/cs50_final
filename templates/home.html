        Heartbeat How-To:<br>
        This website is designed to display results of the Heartbeat query system. Users can view results with a product name and run number
        on the Results page. The Query page describes the query and the SQL used to obtain the result. Finally, the Comparison page allows a
        user to pick 2 runs for a product and compare them against one another and see the differences between the 2 highlighted.
